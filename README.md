            <p> <strong>Description:</strong> The Accordion component is a user interface element that allows users to
                expand and collapse content sections by clicking on the accordion titles.It provides both single and
                multiple selection modes, enabling users to select one or multiple items at a time.
                <br>
                <strong>Concepts:</strong>
                <br>
                <em>State Management:</em> Utilizing React's useState hook to manage the state of selected items
                (selected for single selection mode and multiple for multi-selection mode).
                <br>
                <em>Event Handling:</em> Handling click events on the accordion titles to toggle item selection and
                enable
                multi-selection mode.
                <br>
                <em>Conditional Rendering:</em> Dynamically rendering content sections based on the selected items and
                the current
                selection mode.
                <br>
                <em>Component Styling:</em> Applying CSS classes dynamically to style selected items and indicate their
                active state.
                <br>
                <em>Component Composition:</em> Structuring the Accordion component with reusable title and content
                sections,
                enhancing modularity and reusability.
